        <p>PicPlace is a social network to improve travelers’ experience when arriving to a new place. It aims to generate a community to create a map with the best spots to take pictures of the different points of interests (POIs). By doing this, a new way of traveling would raise, including no time wasting and a collection of beautiful memories. </p>

                        <h2>Idea Generation</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>We faced a problem while doing some travel: We were in Cologne, admiring the huge and beautiful cathedral. We always take some pictures that later we can share to our friends and family, and this time was not an exception. But, at that moment we could not get a good picture to appreciate the cathedral. We spent some time walking and hoping to finally take a picture that satisfies our goal. Unfortunately, the mission was not accomplished that day. It was not until the following day, when we were visiting another attraction and we were surprised by an incredible view of the cathedral. Happily, we took some amazing pictures and showed them to our friends and relatives. By that time, we realized that maybe we could have found some better spots for taking photos in previous trips. </p>

                        <h2>Data Gathering</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>So an idea crossed our minds: a tool that helps tourists to find the best photo spots. Focusing on that goal, we started thinking of what that tool should include in order to really help travellers. First of all, of course, Points of Interests, the main reason for travelling and taking pictures, each of them containing the location, a bit of relevant information and the Photo Spots uploaded by users. Referring to these last, they are the core feature of the system. They should be composed of the location respecting to the POI and the photos uploaded. Finally, the Tour making feature: each spot can be added to a custom tour, and later get directions for reaching them. 
                            Regarding photos, we thought that the tool would be more successful as a social network, where users can share and discover pictures, deciding which ones they like or dislike. In addition, you can follow other users in order to discover what they post easier.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                </header>
                <p>While going on a trip and visiting new places there are several challenges that the tourist/explorer must face while looking for the perfect picture/view. There are four main causes that prevent or decreases the experience of finding the right spot.</p>
                <ul class="links">
                    <li>
                        <strong>New to the city.</strong> Travelers tend to stay around the known areas that not always have the best spots to take pictures or enjoy the view.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Not enough time.</strong> This prevents the traveler from looking for the best places to take pictures as he needs to cover lots of places.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Low technical skills.</strong> Many travelers do not have the technical or artistic knowledge to choose the right spot for a photograph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Inadequate type of camera</strong> Not all spots to take pictures are adequate to all types of camera. So although the spot is right, it may not be right for the type of camera the person has.
                    </li>
                </ul>
