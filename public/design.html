            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p>PicPlace is a social network that aims to improve the travelers’ experience when arriving to a new place. To fulfil this, PicPlace relies on a community of users that upload pictures from different POIs indicating the spot location from where they were taken. Within the system, users can view these images and the corresponding spots, enhancing their experience during a trip. </p>
            <p>Moreover, PicPlace offers the possibility to create tours composed by photo spots. As a result of this, tourists do not waste time in finding the spots by the fact that the application will guide them, showing directions for the selected spots.</p>
            <p>In matters of UX, PicPlace’s main aim are travelers who might not have technical experience in photography and also those who do not have much time to find the best spot to take a picture. To accomplish this, the application would run in a user-friendly environment, so that families, couples, solo travellers, friends, and any person who likes travelling and taking photos can use the tool. Apart from the easiness of usage, the application would include the main information of the POI, educating the users a bit more about the place they are visiting. Respecting social aspects, PicPlace considers two points of view, one within the app and the other one external. The first one refers to a simple way to share and like/dislike pictures, and the second one allude to the possibility of sharing to an external social networks.</p>
