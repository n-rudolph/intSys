                <h2>Platform</h2>
                <p>After some observation, research and own experience, we get to the conclusion that nowadays the Smartphone is the best friend of today’s travellers. While travelling around Europe we observed this behavior in all potential users, they used the smartphone for almost any aspect of a planned trip, for booking hotels, for getting tickets for visiting some POIs, to get a taxi or an Uber, and the most important for us to navigate through the cities and take photos. That’s why we decided to focus on a mobile app for every Operating system available on the market, but without closing the possibility to expand the system to other platforms in the feature.</p>

            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p>PicPlace is a social network that aims to improve the travelers’ experience when arriving to a new place. To fulfil this, PicPlace relies on a community of users that upload pictures from different POIs indicating the spot location from where they were taken. Within the system, users can view these images and the corresponding spots, enhancing their experience during a trip. </p>
            <p>Moreover, PicPlace offers the possibility to create tours composed by photo spots. As a result of this, tourists do not waste time in finding the spots by the fact that the application will guide them, showing directions for the selected spots.</p>
            <p>In matters of UX, PicPlace’s main aim are travelers who might not have technical experience in photography and also those who do not have much time to find the best spot to take a picture. To accomplish this, the application would run in a user-friendly environment, so that families, couples, solo travellers, friends, and any person who likes travelling and taking photos can use the tool. Apart from the easiness of usage, the application would include the main information of the POI, educating the users a bit more about the place they are visiting. Respecting social aspects, PicPlace considers two points of view, one within the app and the other one external. The first one refers to a simple way to share and like/dislike pictures, and the second one allude to the possibility of sharing to an external social networks.</p>

                <h2>UI Design</h2>
                <p>In this matter we decided that we would not reinvent the wheel and create a UI familiar to the user, we followed the same design patterns used in many mobile applications nowadays, especially the ones used in Instagram and Google Maps, two systems that combined may be compared to Picplace. 
                    From Google Maps we get the idea of using the design guideline and look and feel provided by Google called Material Design. Also, the map layout, the way they display the information of a POI and the usage of pins to mark the POIs and Spots. Moreover, the navigation style for the custom tours.
                    We get inspired by Instagram UI in the profile layout, image view and the feed to discover the photos taken by the users.</p>
