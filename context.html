            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>While going on a trip and visiting new places there are several challenges that the tourist/explorer must face while looking for the perfect picture/view. There are four main causes that prevent or decreases the experience of finding the right spot.</p>
            <ul class="links">
                <li>
                    <strong>New to the city.</strong> Travelers tend to stay around the known areas that not always have the best spots to take pictures or enjoy the view.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Not enough time.</strong> This prevents the traveler from looking for the best places to take pictures as he needs to cover lots of places.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Low technical skills.</strong> Many travelers do not have the technical or artistic knowledge to choose the right spot for a photograph.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Inadequate type of camera</strong> Not all spots to take pictures are adequate to all types of camera. So although the spot is right, it may not be right for the type of camera the person has.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Needs</h2>
            <p>
                From the analysis of the challenges, of the personas created, the related work and the storyboard we came to the conclusion that there are five main needs that PicPlace addresses. These five needs are order by importance.
            </p>
            <ul class="links">
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep the meaningful.</strong> Every person has the need to record and keep meaningful experiences, situation and memories. PicPlace aims to be a social network to store and share all the moments of a trip with good quality pictures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stimulation.</strong> The travellers wish to explore and discover new places and new experiences, reason why PicPlace allows the users to add and share new spots with the community and to create a custom tour based on the desired POIs
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Self-expression.</strong> In the age of social network people like and want to share with others their experiences and the way they live them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Popularity and Competition</strong> With the increase use of social networks people have the need to share with others and value others opinions. In these way the popularity need is cover by PicPlace allowing to share all the experiences with the community and being able to rank other posts.
