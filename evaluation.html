                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            </header>
            <p>As the above results show, people nowadays travel a lot and love to take pictures. The whole trip process should be taken into account, including the previous steps and the post-trip actions.</p>
            <p>Trip planning is currently considered important, but people are not used to picking a tool to fulfil that need. Besides that, the majority would like to have an application that covers this need.</p>
            <p>Finally, when the travel comes to an end, an important situation arises: sharing memories gathered during the trip. Social networks made this a <i>must do</i>.</p>
            <p>All these facts lead to think that a tool which gathers all these features in one simple interface would be really useful for people, and could be considered as a <strong>need</strong>.</p>
